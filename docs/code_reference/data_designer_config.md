# Data Designer Configuration

[DataDesignerConfig](#data_designer.config.data_designer_config.DataDesignerConfig) is the main configuration object for builder datasets with Data Designer. It is a declarative configuration for defining the dataset you want to generate column-by-column, including options for dataset post-processing, validation, and profiling.

Generally, you should use the [DataDesignerConfigBuilder](config_builder.md#data_designer.config.config_builder.DataDesignerConfigBuilder) to build your configuration, but you can also build it manually by instantiating the [DataDesignerConfig](#data_designer.config.data_designer_config.DataDesignerConfig) class directly.
