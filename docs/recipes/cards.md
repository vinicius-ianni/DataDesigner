# Use Case Recipes

Recipes are a collection of code examples that demonstrate how to leverage Data Designer in specific use cases.
Each recipe is a self-contained example that can be run independently.

!!! question "New to Data Designer?"
    Recipes provide working code for specific use cases without detailed explanations. If you're learning Data Designer for the first time, we recommend starting with our [tutorial notebooks](../../notebooks/), which offer step-by-step guidance and explain core concepts. Once you're familiar with the basics, return here for practical, ready-to-use implementations.
