# Generate Realistic Persons

Data Designer's [SamplerColumnConfig](../code_reference/column_configs.md#data_designer.config.column_configs.SamplerColumnConfig) can be used to sample realistic person data and synthetic personas. Generated using Data Designer itself, as well as a Probabilistic Graphical Model trained on census data, the sampled datasets are grounded in real-world demographic, geographic, and personality trait distributions to capture the diversity and richness of the population.

## Person Objects in Data Designer

### Creating Person Samplers

Person samplers generate realistic person entities with configurable attributes and optional synthetic persona data. Each sampler creates a different person object that you can reference throughout your data design.

```python
from data_designer.essentials import (
    DataDesignerConfigBuilder,
    PersonSamplerParams,
    SamplerColumnConfig,
)

config_builder = DataDesignerConfigBuilder()

config_builder.add_column(
    SamplerColumnConfig(
        name="customer",
        sampler_type="person",
        params=PersonSamplerParams(
            locale="en_US",
            sex="Male",
            with_synthetic_personas=True
        ),
    )
)


config_builder.add_column(
    SamplerColumnConfig(
        name="employee",
        column_type="sampler",
        sampler_type="person",
        params=PersonSamplerParams(
            locale="ja_JP",
            sex="Female",
            with_synthetic_personas=False
        ),
    )
)

config_builder.add_column(
    SamplerColumnConfig(
        name="random_person",
        sampler_type="person",
        params=PersonSamplerParams(),
    )
)
```

### Configuration Options

Person samplers accept these configuration parameters:

**Basic Configuration:**

* `sex`: Specify "Male" or "Female" (optional)
* `locale`: Language and region code (optional, e.g., "en\_US", "ja\_JP", "hi\_IN", "en\_IN")
* `city`: Filter on cities within the specified locale (optional)
* `age_range`: Age range for filtering (default: ages above 18 only)
* `select_field_values`: Filter on specific field values (optional)

**Synthetic Personas Configuration:**

* `with_synthetic_personas` (default: False): When set to True, samples detailed personality profiles, cultural backgrounds, skills, interests, and context-specific personas for comprehensive character modeling. The personas are sampled from NVIDIA's [Nemotron-Personas Collection](https://huggingface.co/collections/nvidia/nemotron-personas), which currently includes [Nemotron-Personas-USA](https://huggingface.co/datasets/nvidia/Nemotron-Personas-USA), [Nemotron-Personas-India](https://huggingface.co/datasets/nvidia/Nemotron-Personas-India) and [Nemotron-Personas-Japan](https://huggingface.co/datasets/nvidia/Nemotron-Personas-Japan).

**Filtering Notes:**

* When using US locale ("en\_US"), you can filter on age range, sex, city, and state
* For non-US locales, filtering is limited to age range, sex, and city only
* You can choose either city or state when filtering, not both

### Locale Support and Data Quality

**Grounded in real-world demographic data:** The best quality person / synthetic persona data is generated by sampling from the Nemotron-Personas collection. This is currently supported for the following locales: "en_US", "ja_JP", "hi_IN", and "en_IN".

**Synthetic Personas:** Available for "en\_US", "ja\_JP", "hi\_IN" and "en\_IN" locales when `with_synthetic_personas=True`. Persona generation adapts to cultural context based on the specified locale and demographic information.

## Best Practices

### Choosing Configuration Options

* **Use locales that are backed by a Nemotron-Personas dataset** for maximum demographic accuracy and realism
* **Enable `with_synthetic_personas=True`** when you need rich character development, personalized content generation, or comprehensive behavioral modeling
* **Disable synthetic personas** for basic demographic testing or when computational efficiency is prioritized

### Effective Persona Usage

* **Match persona depth to use case**: Use basic personas for simple applications, detailed personas for comprehensive character modeling
* **Leverage context-specific personas**: Use `professional_persona` for workplace scenarios, `culinary_persona` for food-related applications
* **Combine multiple persona fields** in prompts for richer, more nuanced content generation

### Performance Considerations

* **Synthetic personas add processing time**: Only enable when the additional data provides value
* **Cache person objects** when using the same personas across multiple columns
* **Consider batch generation** for large datasets requiring consistent persona quality

### Quality Assurance

* **Validate persona consistency**: Ensure generated content aligns with personality traits and demographic information
* **Test across different locales** to understand quality variations
* **Review persona coherence** when using multiple context-specific personas for the same individual

## Person Sampling with Faker

If you do not have access to Data Designer's managed Nemotron-Personas datasets or you need a locale that is not covered by Nemotron-Personas, Data Designer provides a Faker-based person sampler (`sampler_type="person_from_faker"`) that uses the [Faker library](https://faker.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) to generate person data.

**Important:** This sampler generates random personal details that are **not grounded in real-world demographic data**. It's best suited for testing, prototyping, or when you need basic person attributes in locales not yet covered by Nemotron-Personas.

### Usage Example

```python
from data_designer.essentials import (
    DataDesignerConfigBuilder,
    PersonFromFakerSamplerParams,
    SamplerColumnConfig,
)

config_builder = DataDesignerConfigBuilder()

# Use any locale supported by Faker
config_builder.add_column(
    SamplerColumnConfig(
        name="french_customer",
        sampler_type="person_from_faker",
        params=PersonFromFakerSamplerParams(
            locale="fr_FR",
            sex="Male",
            age_range=[25, 65],
        ),
    )
)
```

### Configuration

The Faker person sampler accepts these parameters:

* `locale`: Any locale supported by Faker (e.g., "en\_GB", "fr\_FR", "de\_DE", "es\_ES", "it\_IT", "pt\_BR", "zh\_CN"). See [Faker's locale list](https://faker.readthedocs.io/en/master/locales.html) for all options (default: "en\_US")
* `sex`: Specify "Male" or "Female" (optional)
* `city`: Filter on cities within the specified locale (optional)
* `age_range`: Age range for filtering as `[min_age, max_age]` (default: ages above 18 only)

### Limitations

* **No synthetic personas**: Does not support `with_synthetic_personas` parameter
* **No demographic accuracy**: Data is randomly generated without realistic demographic distributions or attribute relationships
* **Locale-dependent fields**: Available address and contact fields vary by locale based on Faker's implementation
* **Limited filtering**: Only basic filtering by sex, city, and age range
