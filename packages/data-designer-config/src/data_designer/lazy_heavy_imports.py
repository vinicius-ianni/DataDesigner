"""
Lazy imports facade for heavy third-party dependencies.

This module provides a centralized facade that lazily imports heavy dependencies
only when accessed, significantly improving import performance.

The below mapping for lazy imports represents all third-party packages that, if used with
Data Designer, we strongly recommend using this lazy imports pattern to improve import performance.

Usage:
    import data_designer.lazy_heavy_imports as lazy

    df = lazy.pd.DataFrame(...)
    arr = lazy.np.array([1, 2, 3])

Important:
    Avoid `from data_designer.lazy_heavy_imports import pd`.
    That import style resolves the attribute immediately and eagerly imports the heavy dependency.
