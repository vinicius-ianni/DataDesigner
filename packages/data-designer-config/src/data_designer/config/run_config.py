    """AIMD throttle tuning parameters for adaptive concurrency control.

    These knobs configure the ``ThrottleManager`` that wraps every outbound
    model HTTP request.  The defaults are conservative and suitable for most
    workloads; override only when you understand the trade-offs.

    Attributes:
        reduce_factor: Multiplicative decrease factor applied to the per-domain
            concurrency limit on a 429 / rate-limit signal.  Must be in (0, 1).
            Default is 0.75 (reduce by 25% on rate-limit).
        additive_increase: Additive increase step applied after every
            ``success_window`` consecutive successes.  Default is 1.
        success_window: Number of consecutive successful releases before
            the additive increase is applied.  Default is 25.
        cooldown_seconds: Default cooldown duration (seconds) applied after a
            rate-limit when the provider does not include a ``Retry-After``
            header.  Default is 2.0.
        ceiling_overshoot: Fraction above the observed rate-limit ceiling
            that additive increase is allowed to probe before capping.
            Default is 0.10 (10% overshoot).
        rampup_seconds: Optional startup ramp duration.  When greater than
            zero, each throttle domain starts at one concurrent request and
            linearly ramps to its configured peak over this many seconds.
            A 429 aborts the startup ramp and switches to normal AIMD recovery.
            Default is 0.0 (disabled).

    Groups configuration options that control generation behavior but aren't

        disable_early_shutdown: If True, disables the executor's early-shutdown behavior entirely.
            Generation will continue regardless of error rate, and the early-shutdown exception
            will never be raised. Error counts and summaries are still collected. Default is False.
        shutdown_error_rate: Error rate threshold (0.0-1.0) that triggers early shutdown when
            early shutdown is enabled. Default is 0.5.
        shutdown_error_window: Minimum number of completed tasks before error rate
            monitoring begins. Must be >= 1. Default is 10.
        buffer_size: Number of records to process in each batch during dataset generation.
            A batch is processed end-to-end (column generation, post-batch processors, and writing the batch
            to artifact storage) before moving on to the next batch. Must be > 0. Default is 1000.
        non_inference_max_parallel_workers: Maximum number of worker threads used for non-inference
            cell-by-cell generators. Must be >= 1. Default is 4.
        max_conversation_restarts: Maximum number of full conversation restarts permitted when
            generation tasks call `ModelFacade.generate(...)`. Must be >= 0. Default is 5.
        max_conversation_correction_steps: Maximum number of correction rounds permitted within a
            single conversation when generation tasks call `ModelFacade.generate(...)`. Must be >= 0.
            Default is 0.
        async_trace: If True, collect per-task tracing data when using the async engine
            (DATA_DESIGNER_ASYNC_ENGINE=1). Has no effect on the sync path. Default is False.
        progress_bar: If True, display sticky ANSI progress bars instead of periodic log lines
            during generation. Requires a TTY; falls back to log lines in non-TTY environments.
            Default is False.
        progress_interval: How often (in seconds) the async progress reporter emits a
            consolidated log block. Must be > 0. Default is 5.0.
        jinja_rendering_engine: Template renderer used for engine-side Jinja evaluation.
            ``native`` uses Jinja2's built-in sandbox with the standard filter set and
            fewer Data Designer-specific restrictions. ``secure`` uses Data Designer's
            hardened sandbox with additional AST, filter, and output guards.
            Default is ``secure``.
