# data-designer-engine

Generation engine for NeMo Data Designer synthetic data generation framework.

This package contains the execution engine that powers Data Designer. It depends on `data-designer-config` and includes heavy dependencies like pandas, numpy, and LLM integration via litellm.

## Installation

```bash
pip install data-designer-engine
```

This automatically installs `data-designer-config` as a dependency.

See main [README.md](https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/DataDesigner/blob/main/README.md) for more information.
